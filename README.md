# Classification for MNIST dataset ( on going)

This mini project is all about trying out different ways to classify handwritten digits. It's a follow-up to a previous assignment at school where we looked at categorizing 28x28 pixel images into 10 different classes (0-9). The images are in greyscale, with values ranging from 0.0 (white) to 1.0 (black).

Since the images are not that big (28x28), I'm also looking at both simple machine learning algorithms and neural networks for image classification.

I'm going to try Simple Least Quares with MASS, TreeDecision with RandomForest, and Softmax with nnet.

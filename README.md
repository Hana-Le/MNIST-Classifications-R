# Classification for MNIST dataset (in progress)

This mini project is all about exploring different ways to classify handwritten digits. I wanted to build on a previous assignment from school where I learned about categorizing 28x28 pixel images into 10 different classes (0-9). The images are greyscale, with values ranging from 0.0 (white) to 1.0 (black).

Since the images are small (28x28), I'm taking a look at both simple machine learning algorithms and neural networks to see which ones work best for image classification in this case.

I'm planning to experiment with Simple Least Squares using MASS, TreeDecision with RandomForest, and Softmax with nnet.
